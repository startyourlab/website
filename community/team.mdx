### Interested in joining the team?

If you want to become a member of the official Start Your Lab team, please send an email to [ari@startyourlab.com](mailto:ari@startyourlab.com). We're happy to discuss what kind of role you might be interested in and what you can offer the academic community as a team member.

## Industry advisors

The active team at Start Your Lab works with a small group of advisors from the private sector. Each of our advisors was selected both for their interest in seeing academic research teams succeed and their expertise with tools most relevant to researchers. Their advice informs many of the best practices that we recommend in our documentation.

Current industry advisors are listed in alphabetical order by last name below.
