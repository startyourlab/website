[GitHub.com](https://github.com/) is the online interface for GitHub, and it is where
you will sign up for a personal user account. If you a lab director, it is also where you
will create and manage your lab's organization on GitHub.

## Create your GitHub user account

Join GitHub by creating a new user account. The [sign up page](https://github.com/join) will ask you to

1. Choose a username
2. Provide an email address
3. Create a password
4. Select email preferences
5. Verify your account

### Recommended conventions for username and email address

We suggest trying to adhere to the following conventions:

**Username:** On GitHub, usernames are used to identify users in conversations, while display names are not. Whenever possible, choose a username that represents your name because it will make collaboration more efficient and effective.

**Email address:** In the vast majority of cases, your GitHub user account should be connected to you and not your employer. Use your personal email address, such as a Gmail or Hotmail account. This will allow you to continue to collaborate from the same account and maintain a history of your contributions, regardless of your current occupation or employment status.

**If you already have an account**, then the next step is to configure it.
