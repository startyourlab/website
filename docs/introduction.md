## Who is Start Your Lab for?

Start Your Lab is for **academic researchers** who want to
learn how to apply best practices for managing teams, projects, and code
with an emphasis on using digital collaboration tools.

### Your lab as a team

The need to write _at least some_ code together is increasingly common in social science
research projects. Although this guide is not intended as a programming course,
we provide a few short discussions that touch upon the fundamental concepts of reading and writing
code as a team.

**We highly recommend reading through our fundamental [concepts](/docs/command-line) if you are
new to team-based programming projects.**
