Welcome to Start Your Lab's official page for the **Git Goals Tutorial**.
In this tutorial you will learn how to make your first real contribution
on GitHub!

## Prerequisites

Before continuing with this tutorial, please create a user account on GitHub.
You can do so by [following these instructions](/docs/github-accounts#create-your-github-user-account).

## Setup

You can participate in this tutorial using just the GitHub.com interface. To setup this tutorial, open the [Git Goal Tutorial's GitHub repository](https://github.com/startyourlab/git-goals-tutorial) in a new browser window. The steps to follow for this tutorial are detailed here on this page.

### Pick the guide that's right for you

If you are working through this tutorial after participating in an official Start Your Lab workshop, you should select the **Workshop Participant** tab below. Otherwise, you should stick with the **Community Member** tab to follow along with this tutorial.

<Tabs
  groupId="participant-type"
  defaultValue="community"
  values={[
    {label: 'Community Member', value: 'community'},
    {label: 'Workshop Participant', value: 'workshop'},
  ]
} />

## Create your git goals file

We invite you to create a <i>git goals file</i>, where you will describe yourself with a professional summary, a fun fact, and a short description of a goal you have related to best practices. For example, you can view Ari Dyckovsky's git goals file [at this link](https://github.com/startyourlab/git-goals-tutorial/blob/main/git-goals-files/community/aridyckovsky.md).

<Tabs
  groupId="participant-type"
  defaultValue="community"
  values={[
    {label: 'Community', value: 'community'},
    {label: 'Workshop', value: 'workshop'},
  ]
}>
  <TabItem value="community">
    <p>
      To get started, navigate into the <code>git-goals-files</code> folder on the tutorial's repository page.
      Then, open the <code>community</code> folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      While inside the <code>community</code> folder, click <b>Add file > Create new file</b>. Then, name your file
      using your GitHub username, like <code>username.md</code>. Make sure to include the file
      extension <code>.md</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should now copy and paste the contents of the following template text into the live editor for your new git goals file.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="workshop">
    <p>
      To get started, navigate into the <code>git-goals-files</code> folder on the tutorial's repository page.
      Then, open the <code>workshops</code> folder.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Please navigate into your workshop's folder, which you can find by looking for a blue
      folder icon next to a name that identifies your workshop, such as <code>du-psych</code>.
      Open your personal git goals file by clicking on the associated filename ending in <code>.md</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Can't find your named file?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Please feel free to create one inside of your
      workshop's folder by clicking <b>Add file > Create new file</b>. Then, name your file
      using your first and last name, like <code>first-last.md</code>, and be sure to include the file
      extension <code>.md</code>.
      You should now copy and paste the contents of the following template text into the live editor for your newly created git goals file.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Add your git goals

After creating your git goals file, including the [template](#template-for-git-goals-file-contents), it's time to make some updates to reflect who you are and what your Git Goals are.

For this tutorial, we ask you to make the following changes:

1. Change `First Last` to your name
2. Add your pronouns next to your name
3. Update your professional summary
4. Include a personal fun fact
5. Write your best practices learning goal

After you've completed writing the contents of your git goals file and checking out its preview, you should propose your changes to the repository.

## Propose your changes

Below the file editor, use the provided form to write a brief title message that expresses 
the changes you made above (just a few words). You can use the larger text box below to write an extended description, which can help provide more context around your file modifications for both you and your team. Then, click the button to submit the proposed changes.

## Create a pull request

<!-- TODO: Need to add some in-tutorial links to glossary when ready -->
After proposing your changes, you will be brought to a page titled "Comparing changes". This is where you will create a _pull request_, which informs the Start Your Lab team that you would like to add your completed git goals file to the tutorial repository. Click **Create pull request**, and it will bring you to a text editor to describe your pull request.

The title of your pull request should automatically use the summary description text that you wrote in the previous step,
and the body should will like the code block: 

```md
# Summary of the changes made to your personal file

Please delete this line and replace it with a short summary of the changes made to your personal git goals file.

```

To fill out the pull request's template, simply replace the `Please delete ...` line with documentation of your changes.
There will be many other things on the page, but don't worry about them for this tutorial. When you've documented
the changes you made, simply click the green **Create pull request** button. This submits your request and notifies
the Start Your Lab team that you have made changes.

## After your pull request

Once you submit a pull request, the process isn't over, but that's all you need to do for now! At this point, a member of the Start Your Lab team will review the proposed changes to your git goals file and make sure everything works as expected. This
review is _not_ a test and serves only as an opportunity for you to receive constructive, friendly,
and supportive feedback on your first contribution from the Start Your Lab team.

If we happen to notice a way to improve your pull request, we'll let you know by leaving a
comment on the pull request page. Then, when everything
is in tip-top shape, we can approve your changes and merge your changes into the
main, public-facing version of the project. Once your requested changes are pulled into the repository's main branch (the default, working version of the project), your pull request will be closed and you will be able to find your git goals file in the [main tutorial repository's `git-goals-files`](https://github.com/startyourlab/git-goals-tutorial/tree/main/git-goals-files).

<!-- TODO: What happens after pull request submitted -->

## Congratulations on your first contribution!

You did it! You made your first real contribution to a GitHub repository.
