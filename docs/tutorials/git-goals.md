4. Include a personal fun fact
5. Write your best practices learning goal

the changes you made above (5-10 words). You can use the extra text field to write an extended description.

Then, select the option to “Create a **new branch** for this commit and start a pull request.”
In the provided text input, rename the branch (of the form `username-patch-1`) to `username-patch-descriptive-phrase`
(i.e., `username-patch-pronouns`). Click **Propose changes**.

## Submit a pull request

After committing your changes, you will be asked to submit a pull request.
The title of your pull request should be the summary description you wrote in the previous step,
and the body should look like the following code block: 

```md

Please delete this line and replace it with a short summary of the changes made to your personal file.

```

To fill out the template, simply replace the `Please delete ...` line with documentation of your changes.
Then, using the sidebar on the righthand side of the window, add a reviewer using the username **`aridyckovsky`**.
Finally, submit your pull request.
