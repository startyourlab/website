To use GitHub, you need a user account. This page will cover how to create such an account as well as other closely related things (like lab 'organizations').

[GitHub.com](https://github.com/) is the online interface for GitHub, and it is where
you will sign up for a personal user account. If you a lab director, it is also where you
will create and manage your lab's organization on GitHub.

## Create your GitHub user account

Join GitHub by creating a new user account. Go to the [sign up page](https://github.com/join) and

1. Choose a username
2. Provide an email address
3. Create a password
4. Select email preferences
5. Verify your account

### Recommended conventions for username and email address

We suggest trying to adhere to the following conventions:

**Username:** Choose a username that **represents your actual name**. On GitHub, usernames identify people in conversations, so the username is important and will be very visible (more so than your "display name", which is used less frequently). This makes clarity and simplicity important. Changing your username later can create [problems](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/changing-your-github-username) - so pick a username you can live with for a long time. Examples of real usernames include adyckovsky (for Ari Dyckovsky), psokolhessner (for Peter Sokol-Hessner), or ATchustz (for Austin Chustz).

**Email address:** Use your **personal email** (e.g. your Gmail, Hotmail, or similar address) when signing up, *not* your school or employer email. This will allow you to continue to collaborate from the same account and maintain a history of your contributions, regardless of changes to your student or employment status.

**If you already have an account**, then the next step is to configure it. For broad guidance from GitHub itself about profile configuration, see [here](https://github.community/t/optimizing-your-github-profile/10211). Briefly, we recommend that you
- include a clear, professionally-appropriate photo of your face as the profile picture.
- use your real name for your 'display name'. This goes on the top of your profile, but otherwise is relatively easily changed (in contrast to the username; see above).
- write a brief professional bio. Bios are limited to 160 characters. Think about what information will be relevant to people considering collaborating with you, including expertise, interests, title or career stage, etc.

There are also opportunities in the profile to include your location (e.g. Denver), school or place of employment (e.g. your university), your website, and your twitter handle, as you feel comfortable.

:::tip

GitHub profiles do not currently provide structured opportunities to include additional personal information (including pronouns). If you would like to include such information, include it in the brief bio, or in your display name.

### Join your lab's organization

If your lab has a GitHub organization, join it! You may need the lab director to invite you to join or approve your membership in the organization.

**Set your membership visibility:** Choose whether your membership in the organization is **private** or **public**. You can make this choice once you've joined your lab's organization on the "members" page. This doesn't affect your visibility within the organization - you are always visible to other organization members. If you choose *private* , outside people will not see you listed when viewing members of the GitHub organization. If you select *public*, anyone will be able to see that you are a member of this organization. Generally, we recommend selecting **public** membership, but if you are concerned about privacy or similar issues, private membership is completely fine.

## Just for lab directors

**If you are the lab director**, the next step is to create an 'organization' on GitHub. This will provide a central place to host multiple repositories and facilitate collaboration and communication among your team members. For example, any new collaborators or lab members can simply be added to the organization, and thereby get access to all GitHub-related materials for the lab. Once you create the organization, you can then invite people to join.

Then, invite that username to the organization.
