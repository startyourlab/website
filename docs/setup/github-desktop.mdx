[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is an open-source product built by GitHub that makes it
easier to work with Git. We describe how to start using GitHub Desktop in the following steps.

_Please note: This option is only available for Mac OS and Windows. You can 
[read more here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/supported-operating-systems)
about which operating systems are supported for GitHub Desktop._

## Installation

To download and install onto your computer, please follow the instructions on [this
page](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop),
selecting Mac or Windows (depending on your computer's operating system).

After installation is complete, open the GitHub Desktop application and continue to the following step
to connect your GitHub user account with GitHub Desktop.

## Account configuration

Now that you've installed the GitHub Desktop application, it's time to connect it to your
GitHub account by signing in as an authenticated user. To proceed with
authentication, use the menu bar's drop-down for **GitHub Desktop** and select **Preferences**,
as shown in the screenshot (on Windows, navigate to the **File** drop-down menu and select **Options**):

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', paddingTop: '1em', paddingBottom: '1em', }}>
  <img
    src={require('/img/setup/app-preferences.png').default}
    style={{ width: '320px' }}
    alt="GitHub Desktop App Preferences"
  />
</div>

In the preferences window, select **Accounts** and click the **Sign In** button for
GitHub.com.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', paddingTop: '1em', paddingBottom: '1em', }}>
  <img
    src={require('/img/setup/local-preferences-accounts-no-user.png').default}
    alt="Local Preferences Before Sign In"
  />
</div>

The application will then ask you to sign in using your browser. You be asked to either
**Sign in using your browser** or **Continue With Browser**. Whichever it is, click that
button, and your default browser will be opened to GitHub's browser application. If you're
not already signed in, do so at this point. Then, you will be redirected to a new page
that authorizes GitHub Desktop to access your GitHub account. It should look similar to
this screen where the GitHub user **@aridyckovsky** is asked to give access to his account:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', paddingTop: '1em', paddingBottom: '1em', }}>
  <img
    src={require('/img/setup/browser-authorize-desktop.png').default}
    alt="Authorize Desktop Window"
  />
</div>

Once you've read the conditions of access using the drop-down arrows, please click **Authorize desktop**.
With the authentication is complete, launch the desktop application (you may be prompted to do so by
your browser, and you should take this chance to do so!).

After a successful sign in, you should be brought back to the "Let's get started!" screen. If you
have already created or contributed to repositories, they will show up on the righthand side of
the application window with a text input field to filter your repositories, such as the
**startyourlab** repositories in this screenshot:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', paddingTop: '1em', paddingBottom: '1em', }}>
  <img
    src={require('/img/setup/local-home-screen-signed-in.png').default}
    alt="Local Home Screen After Sign In"
  />
</div>
